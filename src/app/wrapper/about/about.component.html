    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi there! My name is <strong>Luc</strong>. I'm an Aviator, Developer and
      Photography Hobbiest based in Montreal. I used to fly airplanes and now I
      build scalable and beautiful websites. My journey to becoming a
      <strong> Full-Stack Web Developer </strong> began
      <em>March 12th, 2020</em>, when mass layoffs occured at my previous
      company. After this traumatic chapter in my life, I entered anew. This new
      chapter, <strong>Web Development </strong>, has led me on a chase to
      perfecting my code writting skill. All in all, this career change has been
      a great life changing experience.
